Result of my first assignment for web development. It was supposed to be a CV (resume) but I will probably add that last when I am ready to look for employment as a web developer. 

In this assignment I learned how to start a webpage, insert a picture with and without link, make tables, use background color, change colors of objects, add a second page. We were supposed to add an html form but they are notorious for not working and mine did not work. I inserted my email address instead because I do want persons that are interested in Reformed theology in my area to contact me. 

I plan to add a decent contact me form when I have learned Javascript. Right now I have run the email address through a email encoder at http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html?regEmail=elizabethc51%40hotmail.com&codeEmail=. I hope it works for a while. 

There is no fancy formatting, it took me a while to get the tables right. It is just a plain Jane site done with HTML.

Thank you for stopping by!

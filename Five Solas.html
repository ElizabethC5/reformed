    <h3>A Little Bit About my Journey</h3>
    <p>
      My father discovered this Reformed theology after we had been to and through a number of different churches after God chose those in my family to be His children, that is my father, mother and myself and afterward my two children. He stumbled onto it
      by searching the internet. Sadly, he did not hear any of this teaching in any of the churches we had visited. I was living abroad at the time and he contacted me per email and by phone to discuss Reformed theology. I was resistant at first and
      thought that the ideas were not fair, I thought that surely God must be fair. I did not realize that that is a purely human concept and is not found in the Bible which is the guideline for Christian thought. It took me a few months of studying scripture
      intensely and reading biblically based Reformed literature to accept the teaching. I consider Reformed beliefs to be closer to the truth than any beliefs I held before. In fact, the acceptance of this teaching caused a paradigm shift in my
      thinking, the way I see the world, human relationships and everything. The meaning of scripture has become so much more clear as a result that this has been the most influential idea to affect my life since I became a born-again Christian believer.

    <h3>The Five Solas</h3>
    <p>
      There are five tenets that are considered to be key by reformers and reformed believers today that are also called the five solas if they are expressed in Latin. Today's Reformed believers hold that believers are saved by <strong>grace alone, through faith
        alone, in Christ alone, as revealed in the scripture alone, to the glory of God alone</strong>. Scripture is the first and only source of knowledge about God and Christian life for the believer, and one's connection with God is not based on
      feelings of God's nearness or some possible euphoria. Reliance on the Holy Spirit or what may be considered to be "felt" as the Holy Spirit are strongly discouraged. Pentecostalism is Christian but not Reformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially the tenet "to the glory of God alone" is important for a believer's attitude. God receives all of the glory for redeeming and justifying and saving His elect - those He has chosen to be His children. No one can boast that he chose God
      or that anything good he did got God's attention to want to save him or favor him in any way. All walks of life are measured by this, including worship services. Are worship services glorifying men in any way by putting them in front of the church on a platform or
      causing applause? There is a concept of <strong>God-centered worhip vs. man-centered worship</strong>. Many contemporary Christian songs can become repetitive, meditation-like and cater to man rather than God. Look at the lyrics of the songs in most churches these days and see if they are not repetitive and may tend to glorify man rather than God. Worship is meant to glorify God.
    </p>
    <h3>Other Recommendations</h3>
<p>
  Another recommendation is to look for expository teaching - that is teaching from the Bible that usually goes through a book of the Bible verse by verse. It keeps the pastor on track and helps him avoid teaching on "popular" subjects or worldly concerns.
</p>
<p>
  Also be careful of <strong>hypercalvinists</strong>. Some people are mistaken that normal Reformed theology is Hypercalvinist, no it is not. There are some hypercalvinists out there, maybe an isolated congregation or two but it is certainly not and should not be the norm among Reformed believers. They believe among other things that the Gospel message should not be told to others because God will get everyone he chose anyway. Nothing could be farther from the truth. From a human perspective we cannot know who is chosen and must obey Jesus' command to tell the Gospel to every person. Also, hypercalvinists tend to think that only Calvinists are Christians, that is of course not true. <a href="https://www.monergism.com/topics/hyper-calvinism">Monergism has a good page about hypercalvinism</a>.

I like James White's books too. He uses excellent reasoning with much knowledge of scripture to debate others and has discussions with people from other faiths, a lot of these are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=james+white+debate">Youtube</a>.

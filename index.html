    This page is to give local readers a small sampling of concepts associated with the Reformed faith, it is my hope that it may lead you to read more about the Reformed faith and perhaps come to a local Bible study or attend a local Reformed
    church.

    Reformed Christian beliefs by some known as historic Christian beliefs go back to the time of the reformation, also called the Protestant Reformation, around the years 1500 to mid 1600. Most attribute Martin Luther's Ninety=Five Theses to be the
    catalyst for the Reformation but Reformed sentiments abounded then. The time was ripe
    not only in Germany but also in Switzerland with Ulrich Zwingli and many others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are a few names worth mentioning of those who have had reformed beliefs, but this is not a comprehensive list nor does it span all of reformed history.
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li> Martin Luther of Germany
    </li>
    <li>
      Ulrich Zwingli of Switzerland
    </li>
    <li>
      John Calvin of France
    </li>
    <li>
      Geerhardus Johannes Vos of Netherlands to USA
    </li>
    <li>
      John Gresham Machen of USA

      R.C. Sproul of USA
    </li>
  </ul>

    From the reformation onward come denominations we still know today such as Anglicans, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Baptists and many others. Some of these denominations or splitter groups from them still retain what may truly be called Reformed
    beliefs such as the OPC - Orthodox Presbyterian Church, Reformed Baptists and a number of affiliated and non-affiliated churches.
  </p>
  <p>
    In their quest for retention of doctrinal purity many of these reformed churches have had to isolate themselves from larger denominations that tend to lean toward more liberal beliefs over time. Such a schism is happening in the Methodist Church
    at this time, 2018-2019. I personally know Methodists on both sides of the line, the controversial subject being acceptance or rejection of LGBTQ clergy. Again, it is likely that the more conservative group will be the smaller and will simply
    leave the
    larger group, maybe even leaving the name behind, who knows. Historic Christianity has been chased out of many churches especially since the onslaught of liberal thought in the 1800s introduced by people like Friedrich Nietzsche, Soren
    Kierkegaard or Karl Marx. Their views and those of others like them influenced society to the extent that people tried to apply them to the Bible where they do not belong. New religious movments also influenced Christianity and even Bible
    commentaries. The Scofield Bible prevalent about 1920 spread non-historic interpretation of the Bible that caused many churches to leave historic Reformed doctrine in favor of a watered-down version of biblical interpretation. The Christian
    Church at the time went through a paradigm shift. It will take just such a shift in thought to return to historic apostolic doctrine. The Pauline letters most prevalently, are thoroughly Reformed.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify at least a little what Reformed beliefs are, I have decided to use an acronym called Tulip to explain. Granted, some people don't believe every tenet but may lean toward reformed beliefs, but then they are not Reformed.

              Salvation cannot be lost by those who have it. This is for most of the reformed the most comforting concept, that God having saved a soul will not let it go.

    The main idea in Reformed theology is that from the study of the Bible one is to gain perspective into God's way of looking at things, that is a solid, biblical, Reformed way of thought that most certainly will conflict with a purely human way
    of looking at things, which is more and more the common flow of thought today as the world influences the churches, what could be called liberal thought that is often concerned with concepts of fairness and equity. These concepts may work on
    some levels from a human to human perspective but it is not the way God sees things and not the way He operates according to the Bible. He is not asking for our approval and He does not need to.
